# Automatic-conversion-of-Handwritten-to-printed-text
Recognition of Handwritten English alphabets have been broadly studied in previous years. Optical character recognition (OCR) method has been used in converting printed text into editable text. OCR is very useful and popular method in various applications. Accuracy of OCR can be dependent on text pre-processing and segmentation algorithms. This project seeks to classify an individual handwrittenword so that handwritten text can be translated to a digital form. We used two main approaches to accomplish this task: classifying words directly and character segmentation. For the former, we use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with various architectures to train a model that can accurately classify words.
